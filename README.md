# Concerto

[简体中文](README_zh.md) [English](README.md)

A Fabric-based (Currently) music playing mod for Minecraft.
It supports local files, online musics, and the most important: NeteaseCloud Music.
QQ Music haven't been fully supported due to technical reasons.

More music platforms and more client behaviours will be supported in the future.

### Q & A
- Q: Why some NeteaseCloud musics stopped playing at 00:30?
- -- A: You don't have the privilege of NeteaseCloud VIP, or it requires extra payments.
